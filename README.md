# springer-nature-latex-template

Springer Nature LaTeX is a set of LaTeX templates used in journal article and book submissions to Springer Nature journals and books. It follows the Springer Nature's editorial policy guidelines.

The templates take a "content first" approach, which means that the formatting is minimal and you can just fill in the blanks with your own text. The templates also include options to help you meet journal-level requirements, such as using specific heading styles and including figures and tables.

Springer Nature LaTeX templates are free to download and can be used for any Springer Nature journal or book such as including Springer, Nature Portfolio, and BMC journals.
